The film is named after his famous dance, ""the moonwalk"", which he originally learned as ""the backslide"" but perfected the dance into something no one had seen before. The movie's introduction is a type of music video for Jackson's ""Man in the Mirror"" but is not the official video for the song. The film then expresses a montage of Michael's career, which leads into a parody of his Bad video titled ""Badder"", followed by sections ""Speed Demon"" and ""Leave Me Alone"". What follows is the biggest section where Michael plays a hero with magical powers and saves three children from Mr. Big.
